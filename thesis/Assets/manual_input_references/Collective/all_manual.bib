   abstract = {Recent reports of a high response to bodies in the fusiform face area (FFA) challenge the idea that the FFA is exclusively selective for face stimuli. We examined this claim by conducting a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment at both standard (3.125 × 3.125 × 4.0 mm) and high resolution (1.4 × 1.4 × 2.0 mm). In both experiments, regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using data from blocked localizer runs. Within each ROI, we measured the mean peak response to a variety of stimulus types in independent data from a subsequent event-related experiment. Our localizer scans identified a fusiform body area (FBA), abody-selective region reported recently by Peelen and Downing (2005) that is anatomically distinct from the extrastriate body area. The FBA overlapped with and was adjacent to the FFA in all but two participants. Selectivity of the FFA to faces and FBA to bodies was stronger for the high-resolution scans, as expected from the reduction in partial volume effects. When new ROIs were constructed for the high-resolution experiment by omitting the voxels showing overlapping selectivity for both bodies and faces in the localizer scans, the resulting FFA* ROI showed no response above control objects for body stimuli, and the FBA* ROI showed no response above control objects for face stimuli. These results demonstrate strong selectivities in distinct but adjacent regions in the fusiform gyrus for only faces in one region (the FFA*) and only bodies in the other (the FBA*).

   abstract = {Approaches to obtain quantitative, noninvasive estimates of total cerebral blood volume (tCBV) and cerebral venous blood volume (vCBV) separately in humans are proposed. Two sequences were utilized, including a 3D high-resolution gradientecho (GE) sequence and a 2D multi-echo GE/spin-echo (MEGESE) sequence. Images acquired by the former sequence provided an estimate of background magnetic field variations (ΔB), while images obtained by the latter sequence were utilized to obtain separate measures of tCBV and vCBV with and without contrast agent. Prior to the calculation of vCBV and tCBV, the acquired images were corrected for signal loss induced by the presence of ΔB. vCBV and tCBV were estimated to be 2.46\% ± 0.28\% and 3.20\% ± 0.41\%, respectively, after the ΔB correction, which in turn provided a vCBV/tCBV ratio of 0.77 ± 0.04, in excellent agreement with results reported in the literature. Our results demonstrate that quantitative estimates of vCBV and tCBV can be obtained in vivo. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {The presence of magnetic background field inhomogeneity (ΔB) may confound quantitative measures of cerebral venous blood volume (vCBV) and cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (MR_OEF) with T2*-based methods. The goal of this study was to correct its effect and obtain more accurate estimates of vCBV and MR_OEF. A 3D high-resolution gradient echo sequence was employed to obtain ΔB maps by two algorithms. The ΔB maps were then used to recover the signal loss in images acquired by a 2D multiecho gradient echo / spin echo sequence. Finally, both quantitative estimates of MR_OEF and vCBV were obtained from the ΔB-corrected 2D multiecho gradient echo / spin echo images. A total of 12 normal subjects were studied. An overestimated vCBV was observed in the brain (4.29 ± 0.78\%) prior to ΔB correction, while the measured vCBV was substantially reduced after ΔB correction. Whole brain vCBV of 2.97 ± 0.44\% and 2.68 ± 0.47\% were obtained by the two different ΔB correction methods, in excellent agreement with the reported results in the literature. Furthermore, when MR_OEF was compared with and without ΔB correction, no significant differences (P = 0.467) were observed. The ability to simultaneously obtain vCBV and MR_OEF noninvasively may have profound clinical implications for the studies of cerebrovascular disease. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {In quantitative functional neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and its three components, arterial, capillary, and venous blood volumes are important factors. The arterial fraction for systemic circulation of the whole body has been reported to be 20-30\%, but there is no report of this fraction in the brain. In the present study, we estimated the arterial fraction of CBV with PET in the living human brain. C15O and dynamic H215O PET studies were performed in each of seven healthy subjects to determine the CBV and arterial blood volume (Va), respectively. A two-compartment model (influx: K1, efflux: k2) that takes Va into account was applied to describe the regional time-activity curve of dynamic H215O PET. K1, k2 and Va were calculated by a non-linear least squares fitting procedure. The Va and CBV values were 0.011 ± 0.004 ml/ml and 0.031 ± 0.003 ml/ml (mean ± SD), respectively, for cerebral cortices. The arterial fraction of CBV was 37\%. Considering the limited first-pass extraction fraction of H215O, the true arterial fraction of CBV is estimated to be about 30\%. The estimated arterial fraction of CBV was quite similar to that of the systemic circulation, whereas it was greater than that (16\%) widely used for the measurement of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) using PET. The venous plus capillary fraction of CBV was 63-70\% which is a important factor for the measurement of CMRO2 with MRI.},

   abstract = {Background: Although African Americans (AAs) smoke fewer average cigarettes per day (CPD) than European Americans (EAs), they carry a disproportionate tobacco-related morbidity and mortality burden. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ethnic differences in markers of nicotine addiction, including rates of lifetime nicotine dependence (ND) symptoms, current smoking, and smoking during pregnancy across different levels of peak lifetime cigarette consumption. Methods: Data from 237 EA (N = 118) and AA (N = 119) mothers participating in the Missouri Family Study (2003-2005), an ethnically diverse family study of offspring outcomes in high and low risk families, were used to contrast prevalence of ND symptoms and other smoking behaviors between EA and AA women at low (1-10 CPD), moderate (11-19 CPD), and high (≥20 CPD) levels of lifetime peak daily cigarette consumption. Results: Compared with EA smokers, AAs had lower lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV ND (68\% vs 54\%, P < 0.05), consumed fewer CPD during their heaviest lifetime consumption (18\% EA vs 58\% AA smoked ?10 CPD, P < 0.0001), but did not differ in overall rates of smoking during pregnancy or current smoking. However, stratifying by categories of peak lifetime daily cigarette use, AA mothers who smoked ?10 CPD reported greater lifetime ND symptoms and current smoking than their EA counterparts. In addition, nearly two thirds of AA mothers in this smoking category smoked during pregnancy, and 30\% smoked throughout an entire pregnancy. The respective prevalence estimates in EA mothers were 38\% and 0\%. Conclusions: Stratifying the sample into categories of lifetime peak daily cigarette use revealed significant ethnic or racial differences in smoking prevalence during pregnancy, which were obscured in overall analysis. Substantial public health risks warranting clinical attention exist among light smokers, particularly AA women. Copyright © 2010 American Society of Addiction Medicine.},

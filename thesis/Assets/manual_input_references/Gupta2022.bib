  abstract  = "Visual stimuli from our surroundings are processed by an
               intricate system of interconnecting neurons, which begins with
               the optic nerve in the eye up to the visual processing center in
               our forebrain called the visual cortex. All the information
               travels in the form of nerve impulses that are triggered by
               photosensitive chemical reactions occurring in the retina.
               Several separate and parallel pathways code its processing at
               multiple sites in the nervous system.",
